## About me

<!--  -->

I am a dedicated and passionate Full-Stack Developer, recent graduate of [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), with previous experience in Finance. 
I am motivated to join an innovative company where I can use my passion, problem solving and tech skills to solve complex problems and write clean, tested and reusable code.

## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

#### Adaptable and Self-Starter

- Despite changing countries several times in the last years, I have always been able to work in big-brand companies, such as [Booking.com B.V.](https://www.booking.com/) and [OpenTable - Kayak](https://www.opentable.co.uk/). 

- I left my permanent job in a international company to follow my passion about coding and start a new career as a Software Developer. 

#### Problem solver & Fast learner

- While working at [OpenTable - Kayak](https://www.opentable.co.uk/), I have requested to be involved in the Bank reconciliation; in less than two months I was effectively in charge of it for the EMEA markets.

- While attending Makers, I successfully build multiple featured web applications, in a language I was practicing for a very short time frames.

- During Makers, I furthered my problem solving by systematically breaking the problem down into small tasks and prioriting those. This particularly applies to my Makers Final project, where my team and built an app with multiple features from scracth within two weeks.

#### Excellent communicator with Stakeholder Management and Team working skills

- Working for customer-centric approach enabled by technology companies helps me to develop good communication skills and the ability to identify and correctly interpret Stakeholders' needs and expectations and avoid miscommunication. 

- During Makers, I frequently paired programming with multiple individuals, demonstrating a clearly and effectively way of communicating and capacity to work collaboratively with others.

- I led Makers Final Project demonstrating teamwork and communication skills. I have adapted myself to take into the account the feelings of others. This helped avoiding any potential conflict ensuring that an optimal working environment is maintained.
