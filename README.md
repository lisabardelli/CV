## Lisa Bardelli

After attending BSc and MSc in Business and Finance and relevant work experiences in finance roles in Italy, The Netherlands and UK, I have approached software development to expand my knowledge and I have figured it out that I have a true passion for it. I decided that I wanted to become a developer. To start my new career I have recently applied for [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), a highly selective intensive develompment bootcamp. I am currently enrolled in the Makers Bootcamp (November 2020 cohort) and I look forward to joining an innovative company as a Full-Stack Developer.


## Skills
- **Initiative**

During the Covid-19 pandemic, I left my permanent job in a international company to follow my passion and start a new career. I must admit that, while I was taking this life-changing decision, I had to go trough a winding path because there are several factors you need to take into consideration such as going through uncertain times, constantly dealing with the question: "What is coming next?", budgeting the unemploment period and being open to the unexpected; however I realized that this was the challenge that I was ready to face and I took one big step in the right direction, because I am fully confident that this is what I want for my career.

- **Roll-up-your-sleeves Attitude**

In the last 3 years, I had the opportunity to change country three times and consequently leave the job I was doing at the moment while I was beginning my work-life. Despite this, I have always rolled up my sleeves trying to understand the job market dynamics of a specif country and be able to found a new job in well-known company, such as [Booking.com B.V.](https://www.booking.com/) and [OpenTable - Kayak](https://www.opentable.co.uk/). That's why getting error messages and debug code do not discourage me, at all.

- **Able to understand stakeholders' needs and expectations**

Having to deal with stakeholders in the hospitaly industry brought me to develop good communication skills and the ability to identify and correctly interpret Stakeholders' needs and expectations. I have been able to learn how to speak the stakeholder's language and avoid miscommunication. Then, this customer-centricity skillset helps me quickly understand the business requirements and translate them into clean, tested and reusable code.
