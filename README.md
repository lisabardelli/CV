## About me

After attending BSc and MSc in Business and Finance and relevant work experiences in finance roles in Italy, The Netherlands and UK, I have approached software development to expand my knowledge and I have figured it out that I have a true passion for it. I decided that I wanted to become a developer. To start my new career I have choosen at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), a highly selective intensive development bootcamp. I have recently graduated at Makers and I look forward to joining an innovative company as a Full-Stack SOftware Developer.

### Roll-up-your-sleeves Attitude

In the last 3 years, I had the opportunity to change countries three times and consequently leave the job I was doing at the moment while I was beginning my work-life. Despite this, I have always rolled up my sleeves trying to understand the job market dynamics of a specif country and be able to found a new job in well-known company, such as [Booking.com B.V.](https://www.booking.com/) and [OpenTable - Kayak](https://www.opentable.co.uk/). That's why getting error messages and debug code do not discourage me, at all.

### Initiative

During the Covid-19 pandemic, I left my permanent job in a international company to follow my passion and start a new career. I must admit that, while I was taking this life-changing decision, I had to go through a winding path because there are several factors you need to take into consideration such as going through uncertain times, constantly dealing with the question: "What is coming next?", budgeting the unemployment period and being open to the unexpected; however I realized that this was the challenge that I was ready to face and I took one big step in the right direction, because I am fully confident that this is what I want for my career.

### Able to understand stakeholders' needs and expectations

Having to deal with stakeholders in the hospitaly industry brought me to develop good communication skills and the ability to identify and correctly interpret Stakeholders' needs and expectations. I have been able to learn how to speak the stakeholder's language and avoid miscommunication. Then, this customer-centricity skillset helps me quickly understand the business requirements and translate them into clean, tested and reusable code.
